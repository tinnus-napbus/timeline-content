Urbit used to have a web UI called Modulo, which looked like:

A little while ago, Landscape was updated with a new experimental UI. After
some development it's had its first stable release called OS1, which looks
like:

OS1 is designed as a communication tool for groups. Private or public groups can
be created, and chat, notebook or collection channels can be created within
them.
