Doccords allow structured documentation to be integrated into Hoon source code.
Doccord runes can be used to name and document things like arms in cores. The
compiled hoon will then include the documentation. Other developers can query
the doccords to see what a particular function does in an agent or library, or
view the documentation for the whole thing.
