Links is a new communication tool, to go with the existing Chat and Publish
apps. Links is a "social bookmarking" app, where users can post links to
interesting things on the web, and others can comment on them. This is similar
to sites like Reddit, but with a simple chronological order, since they're
scoped to smaller groups. Initially the posts are just simple links you can
follow, but richer content embedding will be expanded in the future,
facilitating different ways to browse the collections.

This is the first new app for the experimental OS1 interface.
