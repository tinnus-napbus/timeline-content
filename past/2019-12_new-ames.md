Previously, the networking [Vane](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vane)
[Ames](https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ames) did not fully extend Arvo's
internal `duct` messaging mechanics across the network. You could `%pass`
messages to other ships, but they could not `%give` any response apart from an
"ack" (acknowledgement). This made inter-ship subscription mechanics
complicated, since it meant you needed a separate system to track which response
corresponded to which subscription.

New Ames allows `%give` responses over the network, greatly simplifying
subscriptions, and therefore Gall and Gall agents. Additionally, it introduces a
system for handling "back pressure", so Gall can automatically kick a subscriber
if too many unsent outbound messages accumulate. It also simplifies the Ames
protocol.
