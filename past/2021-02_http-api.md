`@urbit/http-api` is an NPM package which makes it easy to talk to an Urbit ship
from a web browser. Eyre's channel system and scry interface are implemented in
full. You can authenticate, poke, scry, and subscribe to Gall agents running on
a ship with simple method calls to an instance of the `Urbit` class it contains.
The package also manages the EventSource object and event acknowledgements for
you, so you can give it a callback for handling events and just deal with the
JSON data as it arrives.

This makes it much simpler to develop web apps that integrate with Urbit.
