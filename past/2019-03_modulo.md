Modulo is a new Landscape UI:

Modulo is organized around app tiles, and each app is now a discrete,
independent application. Chat and notebook publishing apps are included with
better interfaces. Modulo is intended to make it easier for other developers to
create their own apps, and for the interface to feel more like the computer it
actually is.

Modulo replaces the old UI which looked like this:
